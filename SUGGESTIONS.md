## Priority Legend

- **High Priority**: Core functionality improvements, frequently requested
- **Medium Priority**: Nice-to-have features, moderate complexity
- **Low Priority**: Future considerations, complex implementations

## 🛠 Implementation Plan

- **[In progress] Crossfade & gapless playback**
  We are iterating on a crossfade-aware queue and mpv configuration that keeps playback seamless and gapless. See `docs/roadmap.md` for the technical steps, the settings that will surface the option, and the verification checkpoints.
- **Next stops**
  After the core crossfade/gapless work stabilizes we will expand the story to cover the broader equalizer feature set and the smart recommendation items listed above. Each focus area should be tracked in `docs/roadmap.md` with matching README/CLAUDE callouts so the rest of the team can stay aligned.
